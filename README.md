# Week6-Weather-Dashboard

## Weather Dashboard

The challenge for week 5 was to dynamically create a page that would allow a user to query weather data for city in the US

- What was your motivation? This was challenging, learning the Open Weather API required a lot of time.
- Why did you build this project? It was an interesting challenge to use the JS manipulate the fetch request
- What problem does it solve? The page will deliver the current weather and a forecast for 5 days for the queried city
- What did you learn? A ton to be honest. The most challenging piece was learning the syntax of the Open Weather API.

The main portions of the page that intended.

- Display the current weather data with a weather emoji on the top of the page
- Display the 5 day forecast in individual cards
- create historic locations for the user to access

## Installation

This will work as a stand alone webpage, no installation is required.

Page consists of the following

- index.html
- script.js
- bootstrap dark theme
